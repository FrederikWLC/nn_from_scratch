# nn_from_scratch
Neural Network structure and training (gradient descent) from scratch. 
*It doesn't quite work though.* **Only** with ONE output neuron and ONE data point, does it work as intended. 

Furthermore, a classifier environment is included with the help of openCV and your webcam.

´ml.py´ is for all the machine learning related stuff, while ´program.py´ contains the code for the classifier environment, in which the model can work.
